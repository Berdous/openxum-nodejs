When playing YINSH, you must be aware of that fact, especially regarding the aim of the game. Forming a row of 5 markers brings you closer to victory, but it also costs you one of your rings, and that of course restricts your possibilities for the rest of the game. You could form a row for your opponent-so that he's the one who must continue the game with one less ring-but if you do so, it could well be that you have put him on the road to winning the game. So the difference between a good and a bad move depends entirely on the situation you're in.
